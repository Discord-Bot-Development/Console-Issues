# Welcome to Console Issues
This repository is for Console issues, suggestions, bug reports and the official Roadmap. While this repository has no 
code associated with it, you are able to create issues, add feedback and see Console's Development as it is completed.
  
#### For immediate support, please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/RFSUH8c)

Please read through the rest of this README.md file as it explains how to open an issue, create pull requests, review 
pull requests, make suggestions and more. If you open an issue or pull request without following the guidelines below, 
it may get denied, marked as invalid or closed.

## Issues
Issues are how DiscordBotDevs will keep track of any suggestions, feedback, bugs and development progress.

***Console is not open source and there is no plan to do so.***

### What are Issues?
GitHub Issues is a built-in tracker for repository owners to keep track of bugs, suggestions, and other important 
development steps. If you are looking to create an issue, please follow the guidelines below.

### How to Create an Issue
If you are unsure on whether or not you need to create an issue ask in the Console Support Discord Server, or follow
this list (**NOTE:** *This list is not exhaustive. There may be more reasons then the following to submit an issue*):
* Do you have a suggestion?
* Do you see a bug that needs to be brought to our attention?
* Would you like to see a new feature implemented into Console?
* Do you have a question about Console? (This is not support related but functionality related)
* Is there an issue with Console Documentation?

If you answered yes to any of the above, then continue opening an issue. If not, join the Console Support Server and ask
in the support channel and Support Staff will be available to assist you.

Once you are ready to create an issue, either navigate to the Issues page up at the top and click New Issue, or click
[here](https://github.com/Discord-Bot-Development/Console-Issues/issues/new) to open an issue. From there, you can add
all of the relevant details and information that might be needed before opening the issue. If you choose to, you may add
label(s) to your issue by selecting the appropriate labels on the right side. (**NOTE:** *Any and all labels might be
changed at anytime by any Console developer or Support Staff member*)

## Pull Requests
Pull Requests are how you can contribute to this repository to make it easier for newcomers and have more detailed
documentation on Console.

(**NOTE:** *This repository will only be made up of `.md (Markdown)` files and will have no code associated with it*)

### What are Pull Requests?
Pull Requests are a GitHub feature that makes it easier for developers (or community members) to collaborate on proposed
changes before integrating them into the official project.

### Pull Requests in this Repository
Since this repository only has markdown files used for the explanation of the repo to include labels, issues and pull 
requests, pull requests are only for changing the markdown files. Anyone is able to submit a pull request to add, remove
or change any files or parts of files.

 / Git works*)

### Reviewing Pull Requests
